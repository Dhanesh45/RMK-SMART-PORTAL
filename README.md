### **RMK SMART PORTAL**

RMK Smart Portal is a digital solution designed to replace the traditional paper-based hostel outpass system. It streamlines the approval process for students, faculty, and hostel authorities by providing a secure, fast, and transparent online portal.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**
Hostel students usually fill handwritten outpass forms, wait for manual approval, and face delays or miscommunication.

RMK Smart Out Portal solves this by digitizing the entire workflow—from request creation to faculty approval—ensuring hassle-free movement tracking and improved security.

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**
Traditional outpass systems involve manual paperwork, long approval times, difficulty in tracking entries/exits, and a lack of real-time status visibility.

Students often wait for approvals, faculty struggle with managing multiple requests, and hostel wardens have no centralized dashboard.

## 💡 **Solution**
A fully digital portal that lets students request outpasses online, auto-notifies faculty, and provides a centralized dashboard for quick approvals. The system maintains historical logs, enhances transparency, and ensures smoother hostel management.
